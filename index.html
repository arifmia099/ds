	<h1>The Prophet (M) said: There are two blessings which many people lose: (They are) health and free time for doing good.</h1>
	<h2>O Allah! I seek refuge with You from worry and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from cowardice and miserliness, from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by (other) men.</h2>
	<h3>When a man says I cannot, he has made a suggestion to himself. He has weakened his power of accomplishing that which otherwise would have been accomplished.</h3>
	<h4>Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.</h4>
	<p>Are you waiting for the “right moment” to take the first step towards change? Or maybe you’re waiting for someone else to help you?</p>

	<h5>And whoever fears Allah – He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah – then He is sufficient for him…</h5>
    <h6>And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives</h6>
